<h3>What is R and RStudio?</h3>
<p><strong>R</strong> is a programming language and environment for statistical analysis and visualization. It was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and colleagues. R is an open source software and mostly preferred by scientist all around the world for statistical analysis. It can do a wide variety of statistical techniques such as linear and non-linear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series, genomics, clustering, Bayesian statistics, etc. R can also out plots and figures that are publication-ready and are highly costumizable.

<p><strong>RStudio</strong>, on the other hand, is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It is like your folder of notebooks and papers it organizes your work flow effectively and efficiently. This makes working with R faster and smoother.

<h2>Creating your working directory</h2>
<p>After downloading R and RStudio and before starting your data analysis, it is best to set up first your working directory. This is important to have one folder in your computer to organize all your data analysis files. To set-up your working directory, just follow these few easy steps below. <i>Note: These steps are only applicable to Windows and MacOS machines</i>.</p>
Step 1. Click <i><b>File</b></i> then <i><b>New Project</b></i>

Step 4. Then, write your preferred <i><b>Directory Name</b></i> and specify the folder location to which the new directory will be saved by clicking the <i><b>Browse</b></i> button. Afterwards, select <i><b>Create Project</b></i>

<div id="section-3" class="section level4">
<h4></h4>
Now, you have successfully created your working directory. To verify this, you must be able to see a <i><b>.Rproj</b></i> file in the <i><b>Files</b></i> tab on the bottom right corner of Rstudio.

If you browse to the folder location where your working directory was specifically saved, you can also find that same <i><b>.Rproj</b></i> file.
